## Description
Avesban is an updated version of the original AdvancedBanX
plugin made by Leoko and 2vY. It is an All-In-One punishment system with warns, 
tempwarns, mutes, tempmutes, bans, tempbans, ipbans, and kicks. There is 
also player history so you can see players' past punishments. The plugin 
has configurable time & message layouts which automatically calculate and 
increase the punishment time for certain reasons. Avesban provides a 
full message file so you can change and translate all messages. There is 
also a detailed main configuration file with a lot of useful settings. At 
the moment, Avesban supports Bukkit (as well as spigot/paper),
Velocity (with a backend link plugin to make anticheat punishments posible)
and Bungeecord. It also supports MySQL and Local File saving as it's storage 
platform with the posibility to migrate your data from locale file storage
to mysql if needed at a later moment.
